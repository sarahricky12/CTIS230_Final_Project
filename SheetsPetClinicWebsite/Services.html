        <header class = "serviceName">Admission and Discharge</header>
            <div class="serviceInfo">
                <p class = "serviceHeader">General Information</p>
                    <p>Surgery is by appointment only. Surgeries are performed Monday-Friday.</p>
                    <p>Patient check-in on the date of your pet's surgery is from 7:30 am to 8:30 am. Please plan on spending between 30-45 minutes for patient check-in.</p>
                    <p>Barring extreme heat, we ask that you leave your pet in the car in its carrier until you have completed admission paperwork. If your pet's rabies vaccination is current, you must present the certificate before spay/neuter surgery. If you have no proof of a rabies vaccination on check-in, your pet will receive a one-year rabies vaccination at an additional charge of $10. A rabies vaccination is included in the feral cat spay/neuter fee.</p>
                    <p>Every pet scheduled for surgery is given a pre-op exam. If our veterinarians see anything that should be brought to your attention, you will be called. Be sure we can reach you easily by phone the day of your pet's surgery. Our veterinarians may recommend pre-anesthetic blood screening when a senior pet has surgery for any reason. All animals spayed/neutered receive a tattoo on a small shaved portion of the underbelly. The tattoo is permanent but isn't harmful to your pet. It is not an extra incision. Early pick-up is 3:00-4:00 pm. Late pick-up 4:30-5:00 pm.</p>
                    <p>You will pick up your pet on the same day of surgery unless you schedule otherwise. If a surgical patient stays at the clinic overnight, a boarding fee will apply.</p>
                <p class = "serviceHeader">Dogs</p>
                    <p>Dogs brought to Sheets Pet Clinic must be on a leash or in a carrier commercially designed for a pet. Clearly label your carrier. We will keep your carrier at the clinic and your dog will be presented to you at patient discharge in his/her carrier.</p>
                    <p>At check-in, take your dogâ€™s leash with you, but remember it when you come back to the clinic for check-out.</p>
                    <p>If you are bringing in multiple dogs or puppies for surgery, they must be admitted in separate carriers in order to be discharged. Even animals that normally get along can get agitated and aggressive as they recover from the anesthesia used during surgery. On discharge: one patient per carrier.</p>
                    <p>All carriers should be in working order with doors that lock securely. Cardboard boxes, laundry baskets, plastic totes, and home-made carriers are not acceptable.</p>
                    <p>Please walk your dog prior to entering the clinic so that they have a chance to eliminate. </p>
                <p class = "serviceHeader">Cats</p>
                    <p>Cats should be transported to the clinic in a carrier commercially designed for a pet. Clearly label your carrier. We will keep your carrier at the clinic and your cat will be presented to you at patient discharge in his/her carrier.</p>
                    <p>If you are bringing in multiple cats or kittens for surgery, they must be brought in separate carriers in order to be discharged. Even animals that normally get along can get agitated and aggressive as they recover from the anesthesia used during surgery. On discharge: one patient per carrier</p>
                    <p>All carriers should be in working order with doors that lock securely. Cardboard boxes, laundry baskets, plastic totes, and home-made carriers are not acceptable.</p>
                <p class = "serviceHeader">Feral Cats</p>
                    <p>Feral cats must be brought in for surgery in a fully functional humane humane trap. You may leave a carrier for post-operative placement and recovery if you choose. Clearly label that carrier. Bring a towel to place in or over the trap or carrier for transport home.</p>
                    <p>Bring one carrier per feral cat for discharge, even if they were admitted in one humane trap. Even animals that normally get along can get agitated and aggressive as they recover from the anesthesia used during surgery. On discharge: one patient per carrier or trap.</p>
                    <p>We loan out humane animal traps for a refundable fee. If the trap is unreturned, or returned broken, we cannot refund your deposit.</p>
                    <p>Social strays do not qualify for the feral rate. If our staff determines that the cat brought in as a feral is in fact social, you will be charged the normal public rate. For an explanation of the difference between a feral and social stray cat, please visit Alley Cat Allies.</p>
                    <p>Since we are committed to ending homeless pet overpopulation, pregnant feral cats will be spayed.</p>
                    <p>All feral cats will receive an ear tip and tattoo to indicate they have been altered and vaccinated.</p>
