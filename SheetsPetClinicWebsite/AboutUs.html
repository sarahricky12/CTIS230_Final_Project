    <h3>The Story Behind the Logo</h3>

    <figure>
        <img id="Logo" src="images/sheetslogo.png" alt="Sheets Pet Clinic Logo">
        <figcaption class="designedBy">Logo Designed by Cheri Freeman</figcaption>
    </figure>

        <p>Every now and again, someone asks about the origin of Sheets Pet Clinic's logo.</p> 
        <p>When Dr. Sheets opened her own veterinary hospital and low-cost spay/neuter clinic years ago, she based her logo on the well-known starfish story.</p>
        <p>A man discourages a boy when he throws a beached starfish into the ocean, because there are hundreds more ahead. 
            “You can’t make a difference,” the man said. The boy bent down, picked up another starfish, and threw it into the ocean. 
            He said, “I made a difference for that one.”</p>
        <p>The little girl pictured in the logo is Dr. Sheets. Her childhood dream was to spay and neuter homeless cats and kittens, placing the ones she could in good homes. 
            The multitude of stars in the sky are the many homeless animals worth reaching for. Dr. Sheets believes that if she reaches just one “star”, she has made a difference.</p>
        <p>Our fundamental message at Sheets Pet Clinic is spay and neuter so one day there will be no homeless cats or dogs on the streets.</p>

    <h3>Testimonials</h3>

    <p class="Testominal">I don't believe you can find a more caring, skilled vet practice anywhere. I appreciate the kindess, the gentleness, the fairness of this practice. It is obvious that Dr. Sheets and her staff truly care about animals.</p>
    <p class="User">- Tequita Scott Williamson / Pleasant Garden</p>
    <br>

    <p class="Testominal">For affordable but quality veterinary care, this is THE BEST place to take your pet to. The low cost does not mean less than ideal care. I would highly recommend this place to every pet owner.</p>
    <p class="User">- Jacqui Hawkins</p>
    <br>

    <p class="Testominal">Sheets is always busy because they provide such great care. You can feel how much they care about your pets and you. They helped me get through the death of my beloved cat, Joe, and even shed tears with me. Now they are treating my sweet Patty for hyperthyroidism, and she is feeling so much better now. I feel like I'm visiting friends whenever I bring in my cats.</p>
    <p class="User"> - Merrie Ann Lail Boltin</p>

    <p class="Testominal">Amazing place. They take care of my cats and give them so much great care. I recommend this place to anyone that loves their pets. </p>

    <p class="Testominal">The most knowledgeable, kind & compassionate group of professionals we have ever had care for our pets!</p>
    <p class="User"> - Marie Caroline Moroney</p>
    <br>

    <p class="Testominal">Dr. Sheets & her great staff are fantastic in every way...professional, competent, friendly & caring towards the pets & their owners.  And, to make the experience even better, their fees are very reasonable, too.  They are so committed to animals in our community that they provide services to numerous rescue organizations at fees that won't break the bank.  These folks are really the sort of people you want to care for your pets.</p>
    <p class="User">- Thomas Antoon</p>

    <p class="Testominal">So glad I had others turn me on to this clinic. The staff here is excellent! They took great care of my shy, frightened dog when I took him in to be neutered. Very understanding, friendly and informative.</p>
    <p class="User">- Nikki Craven</p>
    <br>

    <p class="Testominal">We take our dogs, Lily and Savannah, and our cat, Danielle (whom we adopted at the Sheets Clinic), to Dr. Sheets because she truly cares about their well-being. There's no pressure to buy the latest product, and we always feel like Dr. Sheets talks honestly to us and tells us what she would do if they were her pets. The level of care and commitment we receive is excellent, time and again.</p>
