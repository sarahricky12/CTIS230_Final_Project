    <h2>Sheets Pet Clinic's Feral Cat Fund</h2>
    <p>The Feral Cat Fund operates solely on donations from people who believe the life of a feral or stray cat is every bit as worth that of a pet cat – that they should not be “forgotten felines.”</p>
    <img id="feralCatIMG" src="images/feral3.jpg" alt="Feral Cat">
    <p>With the Feral Cat Fund, Dr. Sheets offers her veterinary services free of charge to those who join us in our commitment to end feral and stray cat overpopulation.</p>
    <img id="feralCatSurgery" src="images/feral5.jpg" alt="Feral Cat Surgery">
    <p>Veterinary services include spay/neuter, rabies vaccination, and an ear tip. If a feral cat is sick, is being relocated, or is nursing, the fund will pay for a “combo-test” for feline leukemia (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV).  In all other cases, we strongly urge that the cat caretaker request that FeLV/FIV testing, which is discounted at the time of surgery. We also strongly urge that the cat caretaker vaccinate for distemper, which is half-price at the time of surgery. We also recommend an injection at the time of surgery for post-op pain. Cats going through the Feral Cat Fund must be brought in humane traps.</p>
    <p>After surgery, the feral cats recover indoors, then are released to their original sites to receive daily food, water, shelter, and veterinary care, should they need it later. Some who can’t be released to their original sites are carefully re-located to barn homes, but those are few and far between.</p>

    <p>Dr. Sheets will donate her skills as a veterinarian to end feral and stray cat overpopulation. She needs your help in covering cost-only for this service to the community. In a short period of time, 10 cats can become 70. Donate at www.gofundme.com/sheetsferalcatfund or by PayPal on Sheets Pet Clinic’s Facebook page www.facebook.com/SheetsPetClinic/</p>
    <p>We thank you for stepping up to show that stray and feral cats are not throw-away lives!</p>
    <p>Sheets Pet Clinic offers to the public a feral cat spay/neuter rate of $60. That fee includes a rabies vaccination, a pain medicine injection, and one laser treatment for post-operative control. This is NOT the same as the Feral Cat Fund.</p>
